### shape as a structural design device

##### _where_ | Aristotle University Thessaloniki
##### _when_ | May 10th-16th, 2016
##### _tutor_ | Alessio Erioli

## . brief

Aim of the workshop is understand the role of curvature and elements such as creases, crests and ridges in the structural behavior and performance distribution of architectural systems.
Starting from the analysis of case studies from architcture and biology

Using detail as the form of procedural information [1], the workshop outcome will span several scales, the definition of the system detail being decisive and propagative in its influence on the systemâ€™s growth, shape and performance.
